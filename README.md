- Mushrooms of class 0 and class 1 , means two different types of mushroom are classified using Naive Classifier
- We use a data sets having 22 features of mushroom
- Naive Classifier used for big data set and gives 99% Accuracy in this case
- we also made some function to calculate posterior probabilty, conditional probability etc... 
- Also calculated Likelihood 
- Here we neglected marginal probabilty
